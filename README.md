# Build a Camper Leaderboard

* Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/eZGMjp/.

* Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

* User Story: I can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.

* User Story: I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.

* User Story: I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.

* Hint: To get the top 100 campers for the last 30 days: https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/recent.

* Hint: To get the top 100 campers of all time: https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/alltime.

* Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

* When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

* You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
